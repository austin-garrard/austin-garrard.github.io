<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	My name is Austin Garrard. As you can see from my <a href="http://dotabuff.com/players/19745006">dotabuff</a>, I've played way too much DotA over the past couple years. You might think this makes me an expert of some kind, but I'm still pretty much a scrub. In addition to this blog, I write articles for <a href="http://cstarleague.com">CSL Dota</a>, and work part-time doing Java stuff. I'm also in the process of getting a computer engineering degree at Texas A&M.
