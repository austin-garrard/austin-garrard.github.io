<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	My name is Austin Garrard. In addition to this blog, I write articles for <a href="http://cstarleague.com">CSL Dota</a>, and go to school at Texas A&M University for computer engineering. As you can see from my <a href="http://dotabuff.com/players/19745006">dotabuff</a>, I've played way too much DotA over the past couple years. It's a passion of mine but I'm trying to scale it back in favor of learning to write, cook, program, linux, and so on. One day I will fix the horrendous CSS on this site, but today is not that day.
