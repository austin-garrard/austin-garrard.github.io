Dota 2 Team Manager : Completion Report
                    : Thursday, August 20, 2015
                    : Austin Garrard

The goal of developing a web-client app for Dota2 fans to create their own teams using current Dota2 pro players was achieved. Some specifics of the design were changed during development. Notably, the approach of separate screens was abandoned in favor of a single-screen approach. Also, functionality related to the 'View Team' feature was removed. The tradeoff is that the app is poised for the development of features that are more relevant to the current Dota 2 pro scene.

Features:
  -create a team with a custom name, sponsor, and logo
  -select 5 players from a pool of active professional players for the team's roster
  -view the roster and team information

Deliverables:
  -http://austin-garrard.github.io/d2tm/index.html

Technologies:
  -AngularJS 1.4.3
  -AngularUI Bootstrap 0.13.3
  -Bootstrap CSS 3.2

Further Development:
  -expand the idea of assigning players to a fictional roster to assigning true free agents to true, partially confirmed rosters
