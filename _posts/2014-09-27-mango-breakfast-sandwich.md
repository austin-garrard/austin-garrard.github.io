I’m a fan of breakfast sandwiches, so when I nabbed a perfectly ripe mango from the store I figured I’d try and put it in a sandwich. I also had some asparagus on hand, so I threw that in the mix as well.

First I chopped up my mango, and managed to not eat the whole thing in the process. I made sure to get a couple of flat, relatively thick slices for the sandwich.

I like doing a combination of frying/scrambling my eggs. For sandwiches I usually crack the egg into the pan (on med-high heat) and then break the yolk after the white has solidified a little bit, and flip shortly after. This keeps the egg in one piece that won’t fall apart, and also makes it a lot less messy since the yolk won’t be as runny, if at all.

After the egg I did the toast in the same pan, but I’m sure toasting it would have been fine. I just take any excuse I can to fry things in butter. Then I slapped the egg and the mango on it and I was done!

While all that was going on I had the asparagus in the oven. I’m not sure whether my oven’s thermometer is off, but most recipes I’ve found call for baking around 425F for 10-12 minutes, which for me tends to result in squishy, stringy grossness. When I put the asparagus in my oven for 5 minutes at 400F, lightly coated in oil, salt, and pepper, it comes out crunchy and delicious. Pretty much once I can smell it I take it out the oven.

The plain sandwich was delicious. I tried it again with sriracha which I’m not sure I liked, but if I had some Chipotle-flavored Clint’s Salsa I think it would’ve been great. I also tried putting the asparagus on the sandwich but it was a little awkward to eat, though I liked how the tastes complemented.

In the future I’m going to try it with runny egg yolk and/or bacon and/or baby spinach. And now that I’m thinking about it, I think the BLM (Bacon-Lettuce-Mango) has some great promise. I think I know what’s for lunch!
