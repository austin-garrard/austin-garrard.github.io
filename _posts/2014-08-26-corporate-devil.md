There was no coffee strong enough for this meeting. Astronaut coffee infused with the energy of the sun and cosmic radiation and rocket fuel could not make this meeting tolerable. But there Aaron stood, in the break room, watching the inanely strong coffee he was making dribble into the pot. It was 7:54. He, and the other four people involved in this debacle, were milling around, waiting for the coffee.

“Ugh, you totally put too much coffee in Aaron, I can just smell it.”

The valley girl accent, primly done makeup, and perfectly pressed pink-oriented outfit which changed every day but somehow remained the same that characterized Gina Crowley had long ago convinced Aaron that she was the Devil incarnate. Not those things alone, of course. He had tried documenting of all the evidence, but in the 5 months since Gina Crowley had joined the sales team at DATAMEDI International, Aaron had been hard pressed to keep track of it all. That, and his document had been destroyed in the HR dispute back in April.

Aaron ignored her, as was tradition, and ignored Jimmy trying to pander to Gina with exceedingly emphatic exclamations about properly prepared morning drinks, and ignored Karissa rambling on about her bible study group to Jennifer, who he ignored just because.

8:00 AM on Tuesday, the 26th of August ticked past as the painfully standard cast of corporate employees entered the conference room. Aaron’s pridefully large thermos was filled to the brim with the blackest, most menacing Folger’s he’d made to date, and he plopped down almost satisfactorily at the table as Gina sat across the table from him, eyeing her dainty cup of the brew with distaste.

“Ok team, I know it’s early and some of us had a late night, so let’s get through this.”

Late night indeed, Aaron thought. 

“As we all know, DIA Europe is in two weeks and we’ve still got a lot of prep work to do. Aaron, would you like to kick things off with the demo you prepared?”

In truth, the demo still wasn’t working. He would have to finish it today over lunch, but last night he had gotten enough working to get the check mark on Jennifer’s infamous checklist. He showed it to them, getting a hard-earned and much appreciated “Wow, that looks *so* awesome” from Gina.

“I can’t even imagine how you guys make this stuff work. I love technology!” exclaimed Jimmy, which earned a considering glance from Karissa. 

“Good stuff as always Aaron. Ok, next on the list is...the booth. Gina, what do you have for us?”

“*Well*,” she began. This was going to be bad. When she started with that inflection, it was always bad. “I did some brainstorming, and one of the ideas that really resonated with me was to have a performer at our booth. Not like a clown or some guy with a posterboard or something *common* like that. So I did some research, and I found this *magician* who performs at corporate conferences, and he incorporates his clients’ mottos and vision and products into his interactive performance.”

Aaron stared in open-mouthed shock. Karissa, who had been all formal attention until the word ‘magician’ dropped, glared. She, at least, knew a devilish scheme when it reared its ugly head. Jimmy was rapt with attention. Jennifer seemed less impressed.

“I know it sounds crazy, but he has some videos up on his YouTube that really sold it to me. Jennifer, I have a bookmark on my PC if I could just connect to the projector…”

“Alright.” Jennifer replied, turning to Aaron with the look that meant, “OK techie, it’s your time to shine.” Gina’s gaze followed shortly after, that painted-on smile plastering her face, eyes wide with expectation, nostrils enlarging as wisps of smoke drifted lazily out of them. Aaron’s hands were still clasped to his thermos, but the pressure from all 4 people in the room looking at him expectantly forced him to action. 

Gina offered him her laptop. Her eyes locked on his as the device passed from her to him. He couldn’t look away, even as he fumbled for the projector cable and shoved it into the laptop. How, after all this time, had he not noticed the short, flaming red horns protruding from her skull? Surely he had documented it in GINA-CROWLEY-IS-A-HELLBITCH.docx before HR had looked it over and promptly demanded he destroy it? What hellacious conspiracy allowed that spear-tipped tail, lazily flicking at him, to go unnoticed by the world?

Aaron mechanically turned on the projector, and turned the laptop back towards Gina. She bared her teeth at him in a supposed smile. He didn’t even watch the video. 

“Hm. He’s not bad.” Jennifer said, making a note.

“I *know*!” said Gina. “I thought for sure it was some kind of joke or he was just a loser trying to make his way, but I really think he has what it takes to bring the pizazz we’ve been looking for to our booth!”

“How did he even do that?!” exclaimed Jimmy. Karissa had stopped paying attention, choosing to scribble furiously on her notepad. Aaron was red with rage. This could not, would not happen. He already had to man this God-forsaken booth at this blasted conference at the expense of a whole week’s work, and now wily Lucifer, who had avoided all of Aaron’s attempts to expose him, was going to put this on his shoulders. A magician.

“Aaron, what do you think?” inquired Jennifer.
