**Adulthood** - *2010*

I wrote poetry as a child.

It was shallow and frivolous,

which was accepted, even celebrated.

But now that I’m old and 18 and in calculus,

people think my poetry

shallow and frivolous.

**I will rule the world some day** - *January 2012*

We grew up next to railroad tracks

and made love through the lumbering

roar of trains

We smoked weed out of coke cans,

played in the sun next

to busy streets

There were cars everywhere

and bad music on the radio

people thought the internet was for nerds

they said we’d never make it to Mars

they said trust the president

and get a job

&nbsp;

Things are different now

a little better, a little worse

I can’t complain, this is my future,

my world, forged by the millions of us

who couldn’t sit still

We made this place, we own it

and before long, we’ll burn it to the ground

with selfish intentions

The next epoch will settle in,

built upon the ashes of our folly

and its masters will rule the world

they have created.

**Truth** - *February 2012*

My angel rocks back and forth,

sitting in the corner, pen in hand,

sure not to write anything down

She offers no guidance

doesn’t laugh at my jokes

cackles when I fall

She who knows all

doesn’t seem to know me

or even care who’s underwing

How many poor souls have

suffered her?

How many have emerged as gods,

scathed so perfectly

by her convolutions?

How many has she slain with that sly grin and those 

wild eyes, black and empty,

ever suggestive of my deepest fears?

&nbsp;

My angel rocks back and forth

to her own tune,

bathed in wonder and beauty

unseen to us all

Maybe one day I’ll pierce

her secrets,

trade her my eyes and my heart,

and watch that bitch sit there

while I rock back and forth,

echoing eternity in my head,

wondering when someone 

will finally take my blind eyes away

and give me a heart that beats.
