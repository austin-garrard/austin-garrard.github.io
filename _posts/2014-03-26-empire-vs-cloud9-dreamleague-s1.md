Empire came into this game after a decisive victory versus Fnatic and picked 3 of the same heroes against Cloud 9: Centaur, Spectre, and Dazzle. These picks have been common for the Russian squad of late, and they decided to stick with what works. Cloud 9 also played it safe and went for the tried-and-true deathball composition featuring Luna and Visage.

Once the lanes solidified, we had the Spectre trilane versus the offlane Nyx Assassin on top lane, Storm Spirit versus Invoker on mid lane, and the Luna/Visage duo versus the offlane Centuar. Cloud 9’s Earthshaker, played by pieliedie, jungled it up at first by[ pulling mid lane with Fissure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lImqEq5eVKo#t=66). 

This is something Cloud 9 has been doing a lot recently, and Empire even warded the Radiant ancient camp to limit its effectiveness. However, Sing Sing’s Invoker still managed to dominate Resolut1on’s Storm Spirit due to the pulling, as well as an early gank resulting in first blood for Sing Sing.

After first blood, members of both teams started to gravitate towards mid. Cloud 9 looked to defend their fast-developing Invoker, while Empire attempted to stop him from snowballing. Despite an awkward fight over 4-minute rune which resulted in Invoker’s death and Luna wasting an ultimate, Sing Sing completed his Mekansm right around 12 minutes. Mekansm is rarely built by mid heroes, especially Invoker, but it soon became clear that Cloud 9 had already planned this out.

Because Sing did so well for himself and opted to spend his wealth on a team-oriented item as opposed to a Hand of Midas, his team was able to group as five extremely early and push freely with their deathball. Empire didn’t even attempt to fight Cloud 9 as a team for the next 8 minutes, during which Cloud 9 took 5 outer towers for the price of 2, and managed to snag a couple pickoffs as well. 

After this brief but devastating campaign, Cloud 9 forced a fight on Empire’s high ground and emerged victorious by destroying their top barracks at 21 minutes. Empire stuck around for a little bit longer but everyone knew where the game was headed.

<div style="text-align:center;"><em>GG WP Cloud 9!</em></div>

This game, otherwise unremarkable, was Empire’s first loss in the regular season of DreamLeague. As of today, Empire and Cloud 9 are tied for the #1 spot in the group stages with 5-1 records, Cloud 9’s only loss being to RoX.KIS. I think Cloud 9 has shown, once again, that they are gunning for that top spot in the West, and that they are completely capable of taking it.
