Today was my first day of a class on Artificial Intelligence. It’s a programming course so most of the work is based around learning and implementing algorithms that are commonly used to do “smart” things. For example, finding the shortest route between two points in a city, or working through a timeless conundrum like the [block-stacking problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-stacking_problem). But it being syllabus day as well as the 1-hour and 15-minutes period instead of the 50-minute period, we took the liberty of discussing what intelligence is in the abstract before delving into the nitty-gritty.

We started off with the philosophical angle: what is intelligence? From syllogisms to formal logic to the Turing Test, we discussed what exactly intelligence was, though it seems not even an expert in AI can speak in certain terms on the topic. Next up was the psychological angle: what is human intelligence? Like the solid bunch of male engineers most of us are, we listed off some strengths and weaknesses of the human mind.

The strengths were pretty much what you would expect, interpretation, judgement, learning, and creativity. The very first weakness that was brought up by a student, and confirmed as an accurate point by the professor, was emotion. “Emotions affect the decisions people make, as I’m sure we’re all aware.” The unsaid ‘negatively’ was reflected explicitly in his tone.

Now, I’m all for logic and math and machines and all that stuff, but in a discussion expressly about the nature of human beings and the characteristics of our favorite tool, the brain, immediately tossing aside what is one of our most defining characteristics as a detriment seems a bit...illogical. Yes, it’s irrelevant to the course since machines tend to be inherently objective and no one wants a weepy calculator in any case, but emotion is an extremely practical notion if you intend to interact with another human being, and as engineer(or something close to it), I feel obligated to discuss the issue instead of chalking it up as a “girl thing” and moving on to the math.

My professor’s statement that emotions affect the decisions people make is accurate despite his implication that said decisions are only affected in a negative way. It’s understandable that he and probably most of the class thinks that way, because I , and my dear engineering brethren, suck at emotions. Of course things are going to go south when you wield the soldering iron the wrong way. If someone has a terrible vernacular, and they used “fuckin” and “Goddamn” to get every point across, you would laugh in their face if they proclaimed that language was detrimental to being taken seriously. 

I also used to subscribe to the notion that emotion was largely detrimental, because it had always been a part of my problems and my failure. When I played junior tennis at a competitive level, I never reached my potential because I couldn’t cope with the feeling I got when I lost a match. When I tried to talk to girls and felt embarrassed or anxious at something relatively trivial, I couldn’t figure out how to get back in the conversation. I still suck at emotions. When I’m away at college and I’m homesick, it’s really difficult for me to find the motivation to do what I need in order to succeed in my classes. But I now know that it’s my own lacking feel-bone that’s the problem, not that I’m feeling things all together.

I wouldn’t be more motivated to ace my classes if I felt nothing instead of sadness. I would if I felt fulfillment instead of sadness. I wouldn’t be more successful with girls if I never got embarrassed. I would if I worked on my ego and allowed myself to be embarrassed in a non-destructive way.

Feelings are an integral part of the human consciousness, and for all the geniuses throughout history who have wielded logic like a scythe and reaped precious bounty for the human race, that bounty was only put to use because the rest of us felt for ourselves and for our loved ones. The energy we people put forth goes in many directions for innumerable reasons, but it is all *driven* by the painfully subjective chemical mess inside each of us. What we feel inside is the engine for our efforts, and oftentimes the steering wheel as well. So do yourself a favor: don’t chalk up emotion as a weakness. Being shitty at something is a weakness, address that instead.

I would have liked to bust this tirade out in class, but even if I could’ve it would’ve been besides the point. Human emotion is not something that burgeoning programmers in an intro-to-AI course need to understand terribly deeply to pass the test or write the code. But I do think the discourse we had was shallow and really just boiled down to identifying the parts of the human consciousness that are liable to be emulated by a machine. If that had outright been the topic I probably wouldn’t have gotten offended at the gross oversimplification of human nature. Leave it to a programmer to be overly semantic.
