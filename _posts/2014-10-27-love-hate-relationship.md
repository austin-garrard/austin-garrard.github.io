Baby, I'm hung up on you worse than a differential equation.

Your roots are...your roots are complex, baby, 

and I can't find your particular solution.

A homogenous, monogamous relationship between us

is impossible, baby,

there're too many undamped free vibrations between us.

But gosh darn I can't stop analyzin' your asymptote!

It's absurd how unbounded it is.

Baby, I *need* to see your steady state response,

I can't stand this transient bullshit!

&nbsp;

Maybe one day I'll settle down,

scale down my impulse function,

become an autonomous equation

with stable behavior approaching

infinity.

&nbsp;

But baby, that'd be as dull and as dry as repeated roots.

I *want* the complex ones!

Rock my world with your higher order equations

and one day I just might find the resonant frequency of our system.

Baby, I never know if I can handle you,

but I'ma keep tryin' â€˜till I find *our* particular solution.
