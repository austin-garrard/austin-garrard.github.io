“I swear, if that old hag comes over here and starts a fuss while we’re eating again…”

“Honey, please, just don’t think about her. Don’t even look! There, there.”

“Not think about that weirdo? How could I not…” muttered Henrietta as she turned back to the meal at hand. It was all Dick could do not to sigh, but he had to put on a good show for Henrietta. Her temper of late had been enough to singe the feathers off Icarus’ suit.

“It’s just not right, what she’s done. Gone and ruined that poor young soul’s whole life.”

“Henrietta-”

“I’ll admit,” she said emphatically, “It’s me who starts the fuss. But someone has to say something instead of just letting all this pass.”

Dick sighed.

“I won’t stand by any longer,” she continued. “We’ve done so for far too long. That boy deserves better, I tell you.” By now all the neighbors were watching. When they saw that Henrietta’s tirade had ended, they returned to muttered conversations on the topic of Wilma’s adopted child.

“I think,” Dick said, “that the fact that there have been so few...formal protestations of the situation indicate that perhaps it is not such an abhorrence as some make it out to be.

Henrietta shot him a scathing glare.

“I agree, it is unconventional and I would prefer to see the boy in a more proper arrangement, but for goodness’ sake Henrietta, the poor child probably wouldn’t be alive right now if it wasn’t for Wilma.”

She stared at her food.

“I like Button,” their son Ponyo put in.

If she wasn’t already, Henrietta became enraged. “I told you to stay away from him Button! Am I going to have to talk to your teacher about your behavior again?”

“No ma’am, “ Ponyo said disconsolately. “I’m sorry.”

“What did you do?” she continued. “What have you been up to with him?”

“Henrietta…”

“I will know what our son has been up to, Richard.”

Something snapped within Dick. “Do you not already know, Henrietta? Ponyo is just a child, what could he possibly be up to with Button?”

“Who knows what nonsense that horrid-”

“All you do is demean her and the good deeds she’s aspired to!”

Open-mouthed shock painted Henrietta’s face.

“I am tired of you willing to sabotage an already tenuous situation!”

“Oh! Well! Why don’t you just go on over there and adopt that Button as well, Richard?” Henrietta shrieked. “I mean if it means so much to you-”

Dick stormed off. He was in no mood for this fight, not so soon after yesterday. Fuming to himself, he didn’t realize that he was beelining straight for where Wilma and Button ate, separate from the rest of the community. Unaccustomed to visitors, they eyed him warily as he approached.

“Hello Wilma. Hello Button. How are you this morning?”

“We are well…” Wilma responded cautiously. She had no doubt seen and heard the argument between Dick and Henrietta, and had certainly been accosted on the topic of Button before. Button drew closer to Wilma and said nothing.

“May I join you? I, um, am eager for, uh, some non-combative company.”

“Of course, of course, are you hungry?”

“No, no,” Dick said, sighing.

“All is well with you and Henrietta? I do hope you aren’t creating strain for yourself on my behalf.”

“Not all is well, and I’m certainly not the only one creating tension there. But I’m not concerned.” Dick donned an unconcerned air. “The good will prevail in the end. It is the way of things.”

The Barnevelder hen smiled gratefully. “It is nice to hear such an opinion, for once. Button, tell Mr. Dick what you’ve been up to these days. Go on, don’t be shy.”

“Well,” the small quail said, “Not much really. Just practicing with my wings some.”

“Come now, Button, tell Mr. Dick what you saw yesterday.”

“Well, I was flying around on the other side of the barn, and…”

Button went on about a tall tree, or some such, but Dick could only half-listen. He had listened to the boy talk about flying, not just flapping about the pen, but really flying, soaring up in the sky. Even as a chick, Dick had been fascinated by the other birds which roamed the skies. But now, after years of structured life and confining relationships, the prospect of flight sent his mind spinning. His arguments with Henrietta especially made him think of the sky.

Button finished talking, and Dick said, “That is just amazing, Button. One of these days you will have to bring me something back from one of your adventures.”

“Yes,” Wilma said smiling. “Button is a great little adventurer, and he always finds the most interesting things.”

Button began to preen contentedly, but Wilma sent him off to play with the chicks who had been excused from mealtime. When he was gone, Wilma said, “Dick, I really do appreciate your kindness. It has been difficult, providing Button with the life he deserves, and the few souls who don’t disdain me are a blessing, each one.”

Dick shuffled. “It can be hard to see what is right. They mean well, those who speak ill of you. They are just misguided.”

Wilma glanced at Henrietta, who was deep in conversation with some of the other hens, before turning a decidedly fiery gaze towards Dick. “Indeed. What is right may seem wrong at times.”

Dick drew back slightly as Wilma stepped close.

“But Dick,” she said, “you know what is right. You have a big heart. An admirable quality.” She touched him gently with an outstretched wing. It sent a shiver of excitement coursing through him. 

“I…uh...”

“Shhh. Button is reaching the age where - well, let’s just say he’ll be out tonight,” Wilma said, a wicked grin growing on her face. “A handsome cock might find it’s the..right...time for me as well.”

Dick was in turmoil. His half-sleep had yielded nothing but tantalizing images of open skies and Wilma’s supple curves. Over and over again he imagined himself with that mysterious, kind-hearted woman in an ecstatic celebration of freedom which inevitably ended in him soaring hundreds of feet in the air marvelling at trees which even from that vantage seemed to climb for miles.

Over and over he recalled each and every stinging jibe Henrietta had proffered in past years, each argument avoided in close-minded fervor. He remembered earlier that evening, when Henrietta had gathered the hens and unleashed a torrent of hateful speech and demeaning accusations regarding Wilma and her adopted progeny. All the while Wilma had stood proudly, within earshot, not wilting an inch under the assault.

Finally, his eyes snapped open. He had tried so hard to not make this decision. His mind had told him no, but his body, his body had told him yes. It would likely shock their humble community to the core. His son, oh how he wished Ponyo could be removed from this terrible situation. But he was in the thick of it, as much as Dick was, if not as willing or responsible. And as much as it pained him, Dick had to act for himself this time. 

He found Wilma with Button snuggled under her wing. Stopping abruptly, he was about to turn around and face the humiliation of his aborted decision when Wilma spotted him and gestured him to come closer. As he apprehensively approached, Wilma slowly rose nudging some of the hay warmed by her body around Button to keep him warm. The little quail shifted about, reacting to the cold, but did not wake fully. Wilma approached him.

When they were close, she clucked quietly. “You look terrible,” she said.

“I - it’s been a rough night.”

“Well,” she said, amused, “you’re not off the hook yet.”

Heaven’s no, he was not. “Free me,” he croaked desperately.

She obliged him.
