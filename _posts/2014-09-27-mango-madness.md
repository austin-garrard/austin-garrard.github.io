My roommate Paul has gotten me on a serious mango kick. After stealing slices of his mangos for a week I finally went to HEB and got my own.

The ones at my HEB aren’t as flattering as the above picture, and are mostly green, but they are delicious. In my very uneducated and unpracticed opinion, the firmness of a perfectly ripe mango is roughly that of a perfectly ripe avocado. That’s not a terribly specific metric but if you buy fruit on the regular you know what I’m getting at.

There are all kinds of tricks for getting the flesh of your mango ready to eat, but I just used a knife to peel the skin and cut up the good parts. Mine was a little overripe and things got a little messy. I probably could have made a couple glasses of juice if I had the foresight.

I did have the foresight to not eat all the mango on the spot, as I wanted to at the time. The result was a couple fun and delicious culinary adventures.

### Breakfast Sandwich w/ Mango

I’m a fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I figured I’d try and put some mango in a sandwich. I also had some asparagus on hand, so I threw that in the mix as well.

I thought about this combo while I was cutting up my mango, so I had some flat, bread-sized, and relatively thick slices of mango ready.

I like doing a combination of frying/scrambling my eggs. For sandwiches I usually crack the egg into the pan (on med-high heat) and then break the yolk after the white has solidified a little bit, and flip shortly after. This keeps the egg in one piece that won’t fall apart, and also makes it a lot less messy since the yolk won’t be as runny, if at all.

After the egg I did the toast in the same pan, but I’m sure toasting it would have been fine. I just take any excuse I can to fry things in butter. Then I slapped the egg and the mango on it and I was done!

While all that was going on I had the asparagus in the oven. I’m not sure whether my oven’s thermometer is off, but most recipes I’ve found call for baking around 425F for 10-12 minutes, which for me tends to result in squishy, stringy grossness. When I put the asparagus in my oven for 5 minutes at 400F (or 2-3 minutes on broil), lightly coated in oil, salt, and pepper, it comes out crunchy and delicious. Pretty much once I can smell it I take it out the oven.

The plain sandwich was delicious. I tried it again with Sriracha which I’m not sure I liked, but if I had some Chipotle-flavored Clint’s Salsa I think it would’ve been great. I also tried putting the asparagus on the sandwich but it was a little awkward to eat, though I liked how the tastes complemented.

In the future I’m going to try it with runny egg yolk and/or bacon and/or baby spinach. And now that I’m thinking about it, I think the BLM (Bacon-Lettuce-Mango) has some great promise. I think I know what’s for lunch!


### Salsa

Thinking about putting salsa on my mango breakfast sandwich got me thinking: why not make salsa with mango in it? I looked up how to make salsa, and as it turns out you can do it pretty ad-hoc. There are lots of different methods of doing it, some of which are highly involved and precise, others which simply consist of putting the ingredients in a bowl and mixing. I did my usual thing and read through a few different recipes/methods before settling on one that I thought I could handle.

The main component to any salsa is tomatoes. These fruits are usually very involved to cook with, and I’ve been trying to figure out how to work with them. I’d suggest making salsa as a way to learn your way around this tricky but essential ingredient. There are lots of nuances to the different types of tomatoes that I have hardly begun to explore, so I usually just stick to Roma tomatoes.

The common element to most of the salsa recipes I looked at was to skin the tomatoes. There are lots of ways to do this(Google is your friend). I boiled some water, then plopped the tomatoes in there for a couple minutes. Some people suggest putting the hot tomatoes into ice water afterwards, but for whatever reason that didn’t work for me. I let the remaining tomatoes cool down a bit on their own, cut them in half(see below), held them over the trash and squeezed the water and seeds out. Doing this resulted in the skin coming halfway off, so after most the juices are out you can just pick the remaining skin off and toss it.

After skinning and squeezing/draining the tomatoes, it was just a matter of chopping them up and combining them with the rest of the ingredients. The procedure I decided on called for simmering all the ingredients for 30 minutes. My intuition told me that putting the mango in at the start would result in all its flavor being simmered out, so I put in all the ingredients below except for the mango for about 20 minutes, then added the mango in for the last 2 minutes (I wasn’t brave enough to make it all the way to 30).

The amounts on the ingredient are pretty rough, because I’m more of an eyeballer/gut-feeling type of guy. Regardless, this is what went into my salsa:

* 4 Roma tomatoes (skinned & drained)
* 1 white onion
* 3 habanero peppers (roasted, including seeds)
* 2 limes’ worth of juice
* 1 part salt
* 2 part pepper
* 3 part cumin
* 1 part chili powder
* 1 cup mango (diced)

The result (1 mason jar of salsa) looks a little sketchy looking if you don’t know what went into it, but the habanero and mango really shine through in the visual and taste departments. It starts out sweet, like mango, but after a few seconds the habanero kicks in and you’re coughing and sniffling (the only proper indicators of spiciness). Paul and I are all about the spice so we loved it, but if you’re not into clearing out your sinuses(or your bowels) you might want to use jalapenos, or just don’t include the seeds.

You’re supposed to add lime and/or lemon juice to salsa to keep it from spoiling, but I didn’t really notice the lime in the flavor department. I’ve decided that next time I’m going to try adding it in near the end, like the mango.

When I started out I thought I way overdid the cumin, because the whole house reeked of it, but it turned out well. The pepper I used is some kind of peppercorn we got at HEB put through a spice grinder. I’ve been putting it on everything and I think it delivered here. 

Next time I will probably use less onion and more tomato. The salsa came out kind of chunky, which I like, but I want to figure out how to get a more salsa-y consistency.

It was great with chips, and I tried it in a taco with tilapia and asparagus which tasted amazing. Paul is going to try it with some pork, which sounds fantastic. I haven’t put it on an egg sandwich yet but I’m sure that would work. 

At the end of the day, I’m more excited to have found out the general process for making salsa. I’ve always been a fan of the sweet & spicy combo and I’m stoked I found something that works so quickly, but I’ll definitely be experimenting with salsa in the future. My only regret is that HEB was out of fresh cilantro when I went. That should be a crime.
