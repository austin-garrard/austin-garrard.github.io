My roommate Paul has gotten me on a serious mango kick. After stealing slices of his mangos for a week I finally went to HEB and got my own. The first thing I did was make an egg sandwich with mango. It was delicious. I tried putting Sriracha on it but wasn't impressed. I thought it would be good with some Clint's Chipotle salsa, which got me thinking: how hard is it to make your own salsa?

I asked Google about it, and as it turns out you can do it pretty ad-hoc. There are lots of different methods of doing it, some of which are highly involved and precise, others which simply consist of putting the ingredients in a bowl and mixing. I did my usual thing and read through a few different recipes/methods before settling on one that I thought I could handle.

The main component to most salsa is tomatoes. These fruits are usually very involved to cook with, and I’ve been trying to figure out how to work with them. I’d suggest making salsa as a way to learn your way around this tricky but essential ingredient. There are lots of nuances to the different types of tomatoes that I have hardly begun to explore, so I usually just stick to Roma tomatoes.

The common element to most of the salsa recipes I looked at was to skin the tomatoes. There are lots of ways to do this(Google is your friend). I boiled some water, then plopped the tomatoes in there for a couple minutes. Some people suggest putting the hot tomatoes into ice water afterwards, but for whatever reason that didn’t work for me. I let the remaining tomatoes cool down a bit on their own, cut them in half width-wise, held them over the trash and squeezed the water and seeds out. Doing this resulted in the skin coming halfway off, so after most the juices are out you can just pick the remaining skin off and toss it. 

After skinning and squeezing/draining the tomatoes, it was just a matter of chopping them up and combining them with the rest of the ingredients. I decided to put all the ingredients except for the mango into a pot to simmer for about 20 minutes. I added the mango in for just a couple minutes at the end.

The amounts on the ingredient are pretty rough, because I’m more of an eyeballer/gut-feeling type of guy. Regardless, this is what went into my salsa:

* 4 Roma tomatoes (skinned, drained & chopped)
* 1 white onion
* 3 cloves of garlic (smashed & diced)
* 3 habanero peppers (roasted, including seeds)
* 2 limes’ worth of juice
* 1 part salt
* 2 part pepper
* 3 part cumin
* 1 part chili powder
* 1 cup mango (diced)

The result (1 mason jar of salsa) really shows the habanero and mango. It starts out tasting sweet, but after a few seconds the habanero kicks in and you’re coughing and sniffling. Paul and I are all about the spice so we loved it, but if you’re not into clearing out your sinuses(or your bowels) you might want to use jalapenos, or just don’t include the seeds.

It was great with chips, and I tried it in a taco with tilapia and asparagus which tasted amazing. Obviously it's great with eggs. Gonna have to put it on some pork, too.

I didn’t really notice the lime in the flavor department. I’ve decided that next time I’m going to try adding it in near the end, like the mango. You’re supposed to add lime and/or lemon juice to salsa to keep it from spoiling, but I don't know enough about the process yet to comment. In any case, this can of salsa won't be sitting around long enough to spoil.

When I started out I thought I way overdid the cumin, because the whole house reeked of it, but it turned out well. I still think I'll use less cumin next time. The pepper I used is some kind of peppercorn we got at HEB put through a spice grinder. I’ve been putting it on everything and I think it delivered here. 

Next time I will probably use less onion and more tomato. The salsa came out kind of chunky, which I like, but I want to figure out how to get a more salsa-y consistency.

At the end of the day, I’m more excited to have found out the general process for making salsa. I’ve always been a fan of the sweet & spicy combo and I’m stoked I found something that works so quickly, but I’ll definitely be experimenting with salsa in the future. My only regret is that HEB was out of fresh cilantro when I went. That should be a crime.
