The [Dota2 subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/dota2) has long been a community watering hole, so to speak, but recently its members have taken it upon themselves to aid developer Valve Software in improving their free-to-play title, Dota2. From [revealing game-breaking bugs](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/229qje/tried_to_change_my_name_to_support_or_feed_turns/)  to [providing in-depth analysis of new content](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2257hi/the_clockwerk_announcer_has_the_least_amount_of/), the community has shown that they won't sit idly by, and Valve has noticed.

Valve's Erik Johnson had this to say: "We're really thrilled about all the great feedback we're getting from these individuals. It's great that every time someone comes up with a half-baked announcer idea or discovers an old bug that we can't be arsed to fix, it gets put into a Reddit post and upvoted to the front page of the Dota2 subreddit. We'd like to take things to the next level and adopt this forum as our new Developer Forums in an effort to get more closely connected with the community."

Effective immediately, Valve will be hiring additional staff to read every word posted on the Dota2 subreddit in order to glean consumer feedback and quality assurance, such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/22efjm/this_is_a_major_problem_volvo_major/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1zw35w/nothing_too_big_but_shoulndt_these_two_guys_swap/). The latter post, receiving over 2,200 upvotes, was addressed by adding the suggested change in the very next patch, truly showing how much Valve cares about community input.

[u/jessica](http://reddit.com/u/jessica), who recently made their first post ever on r/DotA2 (which received 4 gold gifts), reached critical acclaim with their aforementioned observation that certain words are censored from Steam usernames. When asked for comment, they simply said "I just want this game to be as great as possible. I hope my contributions have made the world a better place."
