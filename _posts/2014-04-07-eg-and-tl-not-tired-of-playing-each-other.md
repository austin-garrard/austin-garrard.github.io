Seven days into the month of April, top North American teams Evil Geniuses and Team Liquid have played nine games against each other in various tournaments.

“We’re not tired of playing each other yet,” said Liquid.TC after [losing to EG](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/3537-d2l-western-challenge/956-round-robin/3538-round-robin/matches/39272-team-liquid-vs-evil-geniuses-dota2) in the D2L Western Challenge yesterday. “In fact, since FLUFF left, it’s like playing with an entirely new team. It’s been really refreshing.”

This was, of course, after Liquid [lost to EG](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/3145-t-k-o-tournament/861-finals/3152-europe-america/matches/38933-evil-geniuses-dota2-vs-team-liquid) in the finals of MLG TKO: America the day before, which in turn was after Liquid [lost to EG](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/3386-dreamleague-season-1/916-regular-season/3387-round-robin/matches/35936-evil-geniuses-dota2-vs-team-liquid) in the group stages of DreamLeague Season 1 the day before that, which in turn was after Liquid [lost to EG](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/3398-starladder-starseries-season-9/919-regional-finals/3404-america/matches/38786-evil-geniuses-dota2-vs-team-liquid) in the finals of the StarSeries IX Prelims: America the day before that.

Speculators and betters on Dota2Lounge have been less happy about recent events. “You’d think after so many matches, TL would finally win one,” commented an anonymous user. Indeed, Liquid has lost their past 8 series against the newly-formed NA squad featuring budding superstar Arteezy. With TI4 invites and qualifiers coming up, many people are concerned that TL might not be able to make the rivalry match versus EG at TI4.

“I mean, if we beat TL in the quals, we won’t be able to beat them at TI,” intoned Arteezy. “Is it even worth going to Seattle if I don’t get to dunk on those nerds?”

Unfortunately for both parties, the next matchup between EG and TL isn’t for an <em>entire week</em>, raising concerns that the scene might collapse on top of itself during the downtime. Several community figures have noted that there really aren’t any other DotA games to watch, and that “nobody’s gonna have shit to do at work if <em>el clasico</em> isn’t on.”

Only time will tell if the coming drought will do the competitive DotA scene in. Even if we make it through this hell-week, more obstacles face us, including the possibility of a EG-vs-TL-less TI4. Pray that it doesn’t come to that.
