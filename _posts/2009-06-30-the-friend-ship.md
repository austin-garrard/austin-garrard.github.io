*-Shoutout to Molly*

When we pulled into the driveway, the moving truck was already there and the burly men with the back braces were carrying furniture into the house.  There was a boy riding his bike in the street, and he pulled into the next-door driveway as we made our way to the front door.  He stopped and watched us proceed inside, peering under his relatively gargantuan helmet.  I soon learned that he was our next-door neighbor, and was in third grade like me.

I saw him again when his parents came over, bearing confections and welcomes to the neighborhood, but he stood behind them the whole time and peered through their legs.  Maybe a week went by, and our parents arranged a play date.  I went next-door with my mom a little after lunch.  My mom was impressed with how clean and orderly the place was, but I was impressed that he had a bunk bed like me, though his was wooden and mine was metal.  I told him he could make a fort on the top of my bunk bed if I could make one on top of his.  He replied that he had an even better place for a fort, perhaps the best place for a fort.  He led me out back and into the wooded area beyond, and after a short walk we clambered up into his tree house.

All it consisted of was a small wooden platform with short walls, but it was clearly crafted by an expert hand.  The floor was completely level with no gaps or protruding nails and the walls were flush with the edges, maximizing the available area.  It was roughly 3 square strides, just enough to lay down without bumping into the walls.  I told him it was a great place to make a fort, and we promptly set about gathering blankets and pillows and flashlights and other such fort-making paraphernalia.  By dusk we had thoroughly holed up in our little tree fort, encased by blankets and a camping tarp.

Though our first fort was short-lived due to maternal attachment to linens, the second was soon to arrive.  That weekend we set about making a bigger, better fort, but we found ourselves with only the camping tarp for building material, as his mom had caught us sneaking out with the blankets.  Stumped, we sat up in the tree for a while.  He suggested that we could make it into a sailboat instead of just a fort.  I liked his idea, but thought a pirate ship would be more appropriate, since pirates were certainly the coolest things in existence.  He countered that you couldn't have a pirate ship without pirate attire, and we embarked on our first mission of pillage.  We returned with eye patches, capes, parrots, hooks, guns, cannons, and the like.

Thus, with a haphazardly hoisted mast and sail and a motley collection of pirated pirating equipment, we set upon the high seas for adventure, treasure, and plunder.  I was the captain, in charge of steering and navigating, he was the first mate, in charge of spotting ships and land, as well as keeping the crew in line.  He was a whole three months younger than me, and wasn't as battle-worn and ancient as I was(I had a cane, wooden leg, hook hand, and eye patch).  He had an eye patch though, from a fight with an octopus.

We spotted our first land after several months of hard sailing, and excitedly hopped into the row boats to claim it in the name of our glorious ship and her crew.  But as  the first mate prepared to drive our standard into the earth and proclaim that we were its sole and rightful owners, we realized that our ship had no name with which to claim things.  Somewhat taken aback by our lack of prescience, we sat down and brainstormed for a bit.  Nothing good came up, but then he looked me straight in the eye, and in a somewhat somber manner, suggested that we call it the Friend Ship.

It was unanimously decided to christen our ship the Friend Ship.  We then proceeded to plant our standard into the earth, together, thus claiming it for our glorious vessel.  We raced back to the ship, hoisted the sails, scrubbed the poop deck, loaded the cannons, and set a course for adventure.  Off we went, sailing the Friend Ship across the high seas, terrorizing and pillaging the whole way, both of us glad to have finally met a villainous sea dog that wasn't against him.
